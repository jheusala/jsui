JSUI
====

This is one of my older JavaScript UI concept tests. It's pretty much obsolete 
these days but it might still have some useful code or ideas to offer.

Files are originally from [this SVN repository](https://svn.sendanor.fi/svn/jsui/trunk).

Please note: The server side implementation is using 
[OpenJS](https://github.com/jheusala/openjs) insted of 
[Node.js](http:/nodejs.org).
